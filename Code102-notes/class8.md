# Java Operators

*Assigments*

Operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

    const obj = {};

    obj.x = 3;
    console.log(obj.x); // Prints 3.
    console.log(obj); // Prints { x: 3 }.

    *Comparison*

Operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. 

    1 / 2; // 0.5
    1 / 2 === 1.0 / 2.0; // this is true
